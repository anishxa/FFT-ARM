# FFT-ARM
## FFT Application Using ARM Processor

#### Contributor: https://github.com/JoshLobo-21

We apply the FFT using a low-powered ARM core so that it is compact to carry and can be used in the field without much difficulty. Some notable applications of our project are:
1. Used for spying and eavesdropping (military applications)
2. Education and practical demonstrations
3. Signal repeaters and amplifiers
